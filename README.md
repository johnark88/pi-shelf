# pi-shelf
=================================
This was a peer project, groups of 2. We started from scratch. Covering the full stack. At the start of the second day we where told we had to swap our work with another team. Start from where they finished and complete the project. It was a great learning experience, trying to figure out what the other team had done, how they had gone about it and take it the rest of the way to completion.

Project Description
----------------------------------------------
Our client, Prime Digital Academy: Room 2, has asked for an app to simulate the behavior of their shelf. That is, a list of items placed on the classroom shelf.

Any visitor to the page can view the shelf, but only logged in users should be able to place objects on the shelf.

This will require some research, design, an implementation. Include a readme.md that includes the names of the group members and your team name/number. As well as any planning/docs. These can be in digital format or even pics of whiteboard/notebook sketches.

Shelf Object
----------------------------------------------
Items placed on the shelf should have the following data:

description
placer (user)
image url (optional)

Use branching and github effectively. Prioritize your tasks. We are directly modeling a work assignment and part 1 of this assignment is to have an 'EOD Push' - End of Day Push to remote origin master. That is, as you wrap your day's work, merge what works to master and push to github. Incomplete or not-working code can stay on it's own branch and should not be merged to master. This branch can, however, be pushed to github so it is available in remote.


Hard Mode
